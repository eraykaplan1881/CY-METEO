# Projet CY-METEO

## Instruction to execute :

Arrived in the directory of the code, please enter make then execute the shell script with the following command: ./exe followed by arguments.

You can type any argument at any time.

The date must be between 01/01/2000 and 31/12/2099

latitudes must be between -90 and 90

latitudes must be between -180 and 180

## Known Issues :


Sorting can only be done for the -m and -h arguments and only with an AVL. The same goes for graphics of course. We didn't manage to make graphics like those in the project statement.


## Script:

The shell script checks that everything is in order, that you have typed the required arguments correctly, that the arguments have been typed correctly and performs data filtering.
The shell then calls the C program with the arguments we need for sorting the data.
Then the shell takes over if everything went well with C and creates one or more PNGs containing a graphic.

## Help :

To know the different arguments available, just call the script with the argument
--help
