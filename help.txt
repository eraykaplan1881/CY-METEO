Usage: ./cy-meteo -f [file] [data types] [options]

This code displays graphs on specific data from a source file.
It sorts the data with an AVL if no sort is specified.

Two arguments are mandatory:
 - a file argument (-f) 
 - at least one data type argument (-t, -p, -w, -m or -h)

  -f				Argument to be placed before the file name.

  -h				Outputs a graph of the altitude
				for each station, sorted in descending order.
				order.

  -m				Outputs a graph of maximum humidity for each
				for each station, sorted in descending order.
				order.

  -p1				Outputs a graph of minimum, maximum and average
				and average pressure for each station,
				in ascending order of station number.

  -p2				Outputs a graph of average pressures by date/time
				by date/time, sorted in chronological order.
				chronological order. The average is done on all
				stations.

  -p3				Outputs a graph of pressures by date/time by station
				by date/time by station, sorted in chronological order.
				chronological order.

  -t1				Outputs a graph of minimum, maximum and
				temperature by station, in ascending order of station number.
				by station, in ascending order of station number.
				of the station number.

  -t2				Outputs a graph of average temperatures by
				average temperatures by date/time, sorted in chronological
				in chronological order. The average is done
				averaged over all stations.

  -t3				Outputs a graph of the
				temperatures per date/time per station.
				They will be sorted in chronological order.

  -w				Outputs a graph of the average wind direction
				orientation and average wind speed
				(average of the components). The data will be
				sorted by ascending station ID.
  



It is possible to add other optional arguments:


  -a				Argument to be placed before specifying a
				a Argument to be placed before specifying a latitude interval for the search.
				This option can be used independently of the
				of the -g option. Ex: -a 15.90 -50.154

  -d				Argument to be placed before specifying a date range
				date range for the search. To be written
				in the format YYYY-MM-DD
				Ex: -d 2000-01-01 2000-12-31

  -g				Argument to be placed before specifying a longitude
				longitude interval for the search.
				This option can be used independently of
				of the -a option. Ex: -g 15.90 50.154

  -A				Uses only data from the
				Antilles.

  -F				Uses only data from metropolitan France.
				France.

  -G				Uses only data from French Guiana.
				French Guiana.

  -O				Uses only data from the Indian Ocean.
				Indian Ocean.

  -Q				Uses only data from Antarctica.
				Antarctica.

  -S				Uses only data from
				Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.

  --abr				Sorted using an ABR structure.

  --avl				Sort using an AVL structure.

  --help				Display this help.

  --tab				Sort using an array.





Location arguments (capitalized) cannot be combined with each other.
The latitude and longitude arguments (-a and -g) can be used independently of each other
independently of each other. However, they cannot be combined with
location arguments.
